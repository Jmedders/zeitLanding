  Certain features of the Services (as defined below) or the Site may be subject
  to additional guidelines, terms, or conditions. In the event of a conflict between
  these terms of use (these Terms) and those other guidelines, terms, or conditions,
  these Terms control.</p>

  <strong>These Terms govern use of the Site and of the Services. By accessing or using

  <ol>
    <li> GENERAL<br><br>
      <ol>
        <li>OVERVIEW.<br>
          <p>The Site is intended to allow users registered with the Site (each, an Author) to create original literary works (each, a Solo Work) based on prompts of words and phrases (each, a Fathom) curated by personnel associated with us (each, an Editor). The Author of a Solo Work (the Original Author) may collaborate with other Authors (each, a Contributor) who supplement that Solo Work with additions of Content (as defined below) generated in response to prompts of additional Fathoms (each such supplemented work, a Collaborative Work). We may provide you  Fathoms through a Call (described below) or other “modes”, including 55 Mode, 415 mode, withplayground mode, or other functionality described in the Site (together, the Services). Either alone or together with third parties, we may select Solo Works or Collaborative Works (together, Works and each, a Work) for publication or highlighting on the Site (each, a Selection) or in other media (each, a Channel) either independently or in connection with a Call (described below). Whether you are an Author, a Contributor, a visitor, or an Editor (together, Users and each, a User), these Terms apply to you and to any Work you may create, modify, or edit, together with all IPR associated with any Work created through the Site or the Services. IPR means all trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, Moral Rights, patents and other intellectual property rights recognized by the laws of any country. Moral Rights means rights of attribution, paternity, integrity, modification, disclosure and withdrawal, and any other rights throughout the world that may be known as or referred to as “moral rights,” “artist’s rights,” “droit moral,” or the like.</p>
        </li>
        <li>SERVICE CHANGES AND LIMITATIONS.<br>
         <p>The Site changes frequently, and its form and functionality may change without prior notice to you. We retain the right to create limits on and related to use of the Services or the Site in our sole discretion at any time with or without notice. We may also impose limits on certain Services or aspects of those Services or restrict your access to parts or all of the Services without notice or liability. We may change, suspend, or discontinue any or all of the Services at any time, including the availability of any product, feature, database, or Your Content (as defined below). We may also terminate or suspend Accounts (as defined below) at any time, in our sole discretion.</p>
       </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>SELECTIONS AND COMPLETED WORKS.
      <ol>
        <li>CALLS FOR SUBMISSION. <br><br>
          <p>We may create a call for submissions of Works (each, a Call) describing the parameters for Works to be submitted for review by the Editors (the Parameters). Authors responding to a Call may submit Works in response to a Call by following the instructions contained therein. If a Work is chosen as a Selection in response to a Call, only the Original Author will be paid the amount specified in the Call for a Selection, net of processing fees or taxes (the Author Payment). Works submitted to a Call must comply with the Parameters. If you submit a Work in response to a Call, you may not submit the same Work, in whole or in part, to a third-party website or other service not affiliated or owned by us, nor collude with other Users other than Contributors to a Collaborative Work in seeking to influence the choice of a Selection, if any. We may cancel a Call at any time in our sole discretion. Submission of a Work in response to a Call does not guarantee we will choose that Work as a Selection nor pay you the Author Payment.</p>
        </li>
        <li>COMPLETED WORKS.<br>
          <p>After we make a store available through the Site, Users may list a Work for sale or licensing in that store (a Completed Work) by designating a Work as a Completed Work through the Site and following the associated instructions in the store. We may modify the price for a Completed Work. If you do not agree with the modified pricing (the Sales Price), you may remove the Completed Work from the Site store. During the time a Completed Work is listed for sale or licensing to one or more third parties (each, a Purchaser) through the Site, you grant us the exclusive right to market and sell the Completed Work (and Works based on the Completed Work) and will not market or sell the Completed Work (or Works based on the Completed Work) other than through the Site. In connection with listing a Completed Work for sale or licensing in our store, you will be required to execute a Transfer Agreement that sets forth the legally binding terms among the applicable User(s) and us for the licensing or sale of a Completed Work to the Purchaser(s) of that Completed Work.</p>

The reference in this license to "creat[ing] derivative works" is not intended to give us a right to make substantive editorial changes or derivations, but does, for example, allow other Users to create and redistribute Collaborative Works in a manner that allows them to add their own text or other Content to your Solo Work when prompted with one or more Fathoms.

        </li>
        <li>OUR CONTENT.<br>
           <p>Our Content may not be reproduced, copied, sold, or used for any commercial purpose without written consent from us.

    <li>PAYMENT.<br>
      <p>The following terms apply to Users who list Completed Works for sale to Purchasers through the store available on the Site, if any, as well as Original Authors whose Works have been deemed a Selection by us (in our sole discretion) in connection with a Call.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>AUTHOR PAYMENT.<br>
          <p>If you are the Original Author of a Work deemed a Selection by us, subject to the terms and conditions set forth elsewhere in these Terms, we will pay you the Author Payment using the means of payment designated by us from time to time; provided, however, that you provide information to us or to our designated payment processor that permits us to remit the Author Payment to you.

        <li>REFUNDS.<br>
           <p>Refunds will be processed using the same payment method used to remit payment to a User or via any other method specified by us. If a refund is paid to a Purchaser or us and a credit card charge-back occurs, you must reimburse us for the charge-back. We may request a refund for the following reasons: (a) a Selection is Defective; (b) we are required by law or we consider that we are required by law to do so; (c) we determine in our sole discretion that a refund will avoid disputes or increased cost to Sipplets; (d) we process the refund in accordance with a refund policy made available to our Users from time to time on the Site or in connection with the Services; (e) if in our sole discretion, we determine that it is likely that a refund is necessary in order to avoid a credit card charge-back; or (f) a Completed Work is Defective.
